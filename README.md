# **ReadMe Generator**

Welcome to my ridiculously radiacal readme generator!


## Description

Typing up a readme for every single application you build can become a little tedious and boring. This readme will help by creating the readme for you by using Node.js!

### **Tasks completed**

Created a readme generator using node.js and inquirer.


## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Installation

**HAVING NODE.JS INSTALLED IS A REQUIREMENT FOR THIS APPLICATION TO WORK!**

1. Download all files from the repository.
2. CD into the repository.
3. Run this command to install inquirer
```md
npm install inquirer
```
4. Run this command to run the application
